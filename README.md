## Structure of the repository

In this project I wanted to solve the Travelling Salesperson Problem using Python. A brief introduction for the theoretical background can be found in the TSP_review.pdf file. The code is uploaded in pdf format (TSP.pdf) and as a jupyter notebook (TSP.ipynb) which users can download and run.

Before running the code make sure that all the important modules are installed on your device.
- numpy
- random
- math
- pandas
- copy
- matplotlib
- ipywidgets

Usually when you download python these packages are downloaded as default, so probably you wont't need to perform any special tasks before running the code.

## Main goal of the project

During the implementation of the project, the main focus was on Simulated Annealing, but I also implemented an Ant Colony Optimization method and compared their performances. I created supplementary diagrams for both models for a deeper understanding of the problem. Since the hyperparameter tuning can take a lot of time I decided to create interactive plots such that the users can play with the them. This way the users can get an impression how the hyperparameters are influanceing the models. 

As a final result I found that both methods are appropriate for this problem, the Simulated Anneling might be a bit more robust to different choice of hyperparameters.
