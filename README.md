# README

In this project I wanted to solve the Travelling Salesperson Problem. A brief introduction for the theoretical background can be found in the TSP_review.pdf file, the code is uploaded in pdf format (TSP.pdf) and as a jupyter notebook (TSP.ipynb).

During the implementation of the project, the main focus was on Simulated Annealing, but I also implemented an Ant Colony Optimization method and compared their performances. I created supplementary diagrams for both models for a deeper understanding of the problem. Since the hyperparameter tuning can take a lot of time I decided I will create interactive plots such that the users can play with the them. This way the users can get an impression how the hyperparameters are influanceing the models. 

As a final result I found that both methods are appropriate for this problem, the Simulated Anneling might be a bit more robust.
